Signing kernel modules and EFI binaries in the Open Build Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: Not everything that is described here is actually implemented. Even
those parts that are implemented can change slightly.

Packages that need to sign files during build should add the following lines
to the specfile

# needssslcertforbuild
%define sign_files pattern...
BuildRequires: pesign-obs-integration

The "# needssslcertforbuild" comment tells the buildservice to store the
signing certificate in %_sourcedir/_projectcert.crt. At the end of the
install phase, the pesign-install-post script computes hashes of all
files matching the patterns in %sign_files. The sha256 hashes are stored
in %_topdir/OTHER/%name.cpio.rsasign, plus the script places a
pesign-repackage.spec file there. When the first rpmbuild finishes, the
buildservice sends the cpio archive to the signing server, which returns
a rsasigned.cio archive with RSA signatures of the sha256 hashes.

The pesign-repackage.spec takes the original RPMs, unpacks them and
appends the signatures to the files (TODO: only implemented for firmware
files). It then uses the pesign-gen-repackage-spec script to generate
another specfile, which builds new RPMs with signed files.
